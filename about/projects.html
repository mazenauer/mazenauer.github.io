          <h4><a href="https://github.com/mazenauer/Kepler-PINN">Physics-informed neural networks for Kepler problems</a></h4>
          To kick off my semester thesis I read a lot of papers about symplectic ODE solvers and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). 
          Dynamical systems, or ODEs, are best solved with symplectic integrators that preserve a physical structure in the solution. For example, 
          while many integration schemes such as Euler's method or the Runge-Kutta methods do not preserve energy, symplectic methods do. 
          My choice ended up with Ruth's method, it is symplectic, fast, and most importantly: easy to implement and fast in execution.
          Recently, there was development to solve PDEs using machine learning techniques called PINNs. My task was to find out, how feasible it is to solve
          dynamical systems with the same techniques. As a toy problem to benchmark the PINN I was given the Kepler problem with two bodies, that can
          be reduced to a single body moving in a central potential. For those unaware, the Kepler problem is the solution of moving bodies
          influenced only by gravity (electrostatic forces give the same mathematical problem). As such, the system essentially has four degrees of freedom.
          I implemented a PINN for this system in Python using the PyTorch framework, which I needed to get accustomed to first. Piece by piece 
          I built the model, implementing a suitable loss function and a number of helper methods to visualize training progress. 
          While the case of circular orbits worked without problems, the elliptical orbits just didn't want to give the correct result. After days of 
          that headache and coming up with all different sorts of ways to make the model more robust for training I found a sign error in the loss function.
          Once the model was up and running and thoroughly tested I still had about ten hyperparameters that were arbitrarily set by me.
          I was tasked with performing a sensitivity analysis to assess the sensitivity of the final PINN solution on the hyperparameters.
          It took almost a week on 64 parallel processes on the cluster of my university to generate the large number of samples needed to 
          perform the Sobol' sensitivity analysis. The result was that the solution was not sensitive to any hyperparameters in particular, rather the
          combination of all of them. Unfortunately, this made it difficult to efficiently optimize the hyperparameters. 
          In conclusion, PINNs are very well able to solve dynamical systems while also satisfying symplecticity and other constraints. The big difference
          to conventional solvers is that the PINN does not need to solve the ODE going timestep by timestep, which can be very slow for long integration
          times, but rather proposes a solution for all times at once and having to incrementally improve the solution in training epochs. 
          If a conventional needs a step size of 1e-6 and a total integration time of 1e9 it needs 1e15 steps, whereas the neural network might converge
          in about 1e4 or 1e5 training epochs. Each training step of the PINN is parallelizable, reducing the cost of a training step.
          
          During this semester project I was forced to adapt often and quickly. I learned to use the PyTorch framework, accessing the HPC cluster via ssh and 
          sending batch jobs, using git and GitHub to save my work along the way and make it public and reproducible. Last but not least, 
          with our weekly group meetings I learned a lot about communicating my work, helping each other out when someone faces a difficult obstacle,
          and writing scientific reports and maintaining an associated repository.
